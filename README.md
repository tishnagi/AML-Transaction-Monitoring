# AML-Transaction-Monitoring
The Money Laundering Regulations (MLRs) provide powers for supervisors to disclose relevant information to these authorities and to request information both domestically and internationally to support their supervisory functions and law enforcement efforts.
Desk-based reviews (DBRs): Reviewing documents provided by firms, such as risk assessments, customer due diligence procedures, and training records, often supplemented by questionnaires or interviews.
Onsite visits: Conducting in-person inspections of a firm's premises to verify the implementation of policies, procedures, and controls, and to conduct interviews with staff.
Other supervisory interventions: Including issuing guidance, conducting thematic reviews, sending questionnaires to specific sub-sectors, engaging with senior management, and analysing data for red flags. Monitoring activities can be full-scope (comprehensive review) or targeted (focusing on specific aspects of AML compliance).
